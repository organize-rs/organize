# Problem decomposition

I want to build a software that helps me automatically organize my files based
on different filters. These filters match on certain files and users can chose
actions to be applied on the matched files.

This is how we can decompose this idea into its underlying problems:

1. **User Interface and Configuration:**
   - Designing a user-friendly interface to input and manage filters and
     actions.
   - Allowing users to define filters based on file attributes like name,
     extension, size, creation date, etc.
   - Providing options to create and manage multiple filter sets for different
     types of organization tasks.

2. **File System Interaction:**
   - Implementing functions to scan and access files and directories in the
     user's storage system.
   - Handling permissions and security concerns while accessing files.

3. **Filtering and Matching:**
   - Developing algorithms to apply the defined filters to the files in the
     designated directories.
   - Identifying files that match the filter criteria (e.g., matching file
     extensions, names containing certain keywords).

4. **Action Definition and Execution:**
   - Allowing users to define different actions to be applied to the matched
     files (e.g., move, copy, delete, rename).
   - Implementing functions to execute these actions on the matched files.

5. **Error Handling and Logging:**
   - Incorporating error handling mechanisms to deal with exceptions during file
     operations.
   - Providing logs to keep track of the actions performed on files for
     debugging and auditing purposes.

6. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Ensuring efficient algorithms and data structures to handle large numbers
     of files and directories.
   - Optimizing the software to reduce processing time and resource usage.

7. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Creating test cases to verify the correctness of the filtering and action
     execution processes.
   - Validating that files are being organized correctly according to the
     specified filters and actions.

8. **User Feedback and Progress Tracking:**
   - Providing feedback to users on the progress of file organization.
   - Including options to pause, resume, or cancel the organization process.

9. **Data Backup and Restore (Optional):**
   - Considering implementing a backup mechanism to protect against data loss
     during organization operations.
   - Allowing users to restore files to their original locations if needed.

10. **Security and Privacy:**
    - Ensuring that the software doesn't compromise the security and privacy of
      the user's files.
    - Handling sensitive data securely and implementing access controls.

11. **Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
    - Designing the software to work on different operating systems and file
      systems.

12. **Updates and Maintenance:**
    - Planning for future updates and maintenance to address potential issues or
      to add new features.

1. **File Discovery and Matching**: The software needs to have the ability to
   scan through your file system and match files based on specified filters.
   These filters can be file name, file type, creation date, modification date,
   file size, and so on. The challenge here is to ensure the scanning process is
   efficient and does not consume a lot of system resources.

2. **Rule Definition and Management**: Your software needs to support the
   creation, deletion, and modification of organizational rules. These rules
   will define the filters and actions for file organization. You need a
   user-friendly way to interact with these rules, and a rule validation
   mechanism to ensure that rules are well formed.

3. **Action Definition and Management**: Each rule will consist of one or more
   actions to be performed on the matched files. Actions can be move, rename,
   delete, copy, etc. Your software should be able to interpret these actions
   and execute them properly.

4. **Config File Format**: You need a suitable config file format for storing
   the rules. This could be a simple text-based format like JSON, YAML, XML, or
   a more advanced format depending on your requirements. The software should be
   able to read this file, interpret the rules, and execute them.

5. **Action Reversion System**: This system will allow the user to revert
   actions performed by the software. This involves keeping track of changes,
   providing a user-friendly way to view and select past actions, and restoring
   the file system to a past state. It's essentially a version control system
   for your files, similar to Git.

6. **User Interface**: Depending on whether you want this software to be a
   command-line tool or have a graphical interface, you will need to build an
   appropriate user interface. It should be easy to use and intuitive.

7. **Error Handling and Reporting**: Your software should be able to handle
   errors gracefully, e.g., if a file can't be moved because it's in use. Also,
   it should provide logs or reports of what actions were performed, any errors
   encountered, etc.

8. **Testing and Security**: Ensuring that the software works as expected and
   does not unintentionally delete or corrupt files is critical. This includes
   unit testing, integration testing, etc. Also, the software should not be an
   avenue for malicious activities like unauthorized file access.

9. **Cross-platform Support**: Depending on your use case, your software may
   need to support different operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
   This adds complexity in terms of different file systems and permissions.

10. **Performance**: If the file system is large, the software should be able to
    handle it efficiently without consuming excessive system resources. You
    should also think about how to handle potential issues like race conditions
    if files are being modified while the software is running.
